# python_100_2.0

A curated collection of 100 Python projects rebuilt with a more mature,
clean, and maintainable approach, progressing from simple exercises to more complex, real-world applications.”

This repository is a second pass at the original `python_100` project,
revisiting the same (or similar) exercises with a stronger focus on:

- Clean code and readability
- Proper project structure
- Thoughtful class and function design
- Clear module, class, and method documentation
- Reusability and separation of concerns

The goal is not just to “make it work,” but to write Python that reflects
real-world standards and good engineering judgment.

## Project Structure

Each project is self-contained and typically includes:
- A main Python file that can be run from the command line
- Clear module- and class-level docstrings
- Well-defined public entry points (e.g., `run()`)
- Supporting modules when appropriate (e.g., ASCII art, helpers)

Example:
day_007_hangman/
├── hangman.py
├── ascii_art.py
└── README.md (optional per project)

## How to Run a Project

Most projects can be run directly using:
```bash
python main.py
```
Refer to the module-level docstring in each project for specific instructions.

## Why 2.0?

The original python_100 repository was created earlier in my learning
journey. This version represents a more intentional rewrite of those ideas
using better structure, clearer design, and more idiomatic Python.

Both repositories document different stages of growth.
